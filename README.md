This is a spigot plugin made to synchronize players across all the minecraft servers the plugin is installed on. Basically, every player is seen to another even if they are located on a two completely different Minecraft server instances. They can contact each other, chat with each other and more features are being in progress right now.

There is no requirement for Proxy being installed, only to have one redis server.
